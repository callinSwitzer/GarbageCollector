# Plot distribution of wingbeat frequency
Recorded at the Arnold Arboretum and at CFS on wild-caught bumblebees (mostly B.impatiens). 
```{r}
dta = read.csv("/Users/callinswitzer/Dropbox/ExperimentsSummer2014/SonicationFreqLength/BuzzFreqRedoAll2013-LengthByHand.csv")

hist(dta$wing1, freq = FALSE, xlab = "Wingbeat Frequency (Hz)")
```

# B. impatiens only
```{r}
hist(dta$wing1[dta$spp == "impatiens"], freq = FALSE, xlab = "Wingbeat Frequency (Hz)")

```

## plot size vs. wingbeat frequency
```{r}
plot(y = dta$wing1, x = dta$IT, xlab = "IT Span(mm)", ylab = "wing freq (Hz)")
```
